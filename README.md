# Portfolio Website Structure

## Folders
- `assets/images/` — All images, icons, and favicons
- `assets/styles/` — All CSS files
- `assets/scripts/` — All JavaScript files
- HTML files remain in the root for static hosting

## Usage
- Update image/CSS/JS references in HTML to use the new paths.
- This structure is ready for static hosting and easy migration to frameworks.

## Next Steps
- For React/Next.js, move HTML into `pages/` and assets into `public/`.
